## Spollnet

The SpollNet voting system offers a modern and accessible platform that allows students to participate in voting processes easily and securely. With an intuitive and friendly interface, students can access the platform from their mobile devices or computers and cast their votes quickly and conveniently.
One of the key features is its focus on the transparency and integrity of the voting process.

The system uses advanced security and encryption technologies to guarantee the protection of data and the legitimacy of the votes cast. Additionally, it offers tracking features that allow students to check the status of their votes and access detailed information about the candidates and proposals in question.

## Licenses

As a project, we have decided to incorporate Creative Commons Licenses into our student voting system to ensure copyright protection and promote fair use and
open source of created resources. To achieve this, we have designed a simple and effective process to integrate these licenses into our platform.

- The source code of this project is under the [Attribution (CC BY)] license.
- The documentation is under the license [Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA)].
- The multimedia files (images, videos, etc.) are under the [Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)] license.
- Data files are under the [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC BY-NC-SA)] license.

## Execution

In order to start, you need to clone our project, for that you will execute:

    git clone

Next, you need to install some dependencies that are key to the operation of our app, therefore, you will be executing the following command:

    npm i

Having the data files, you need to configure the database (make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine). If you need a database for your project, set up a database in MongoDB and update the connection settings in your project code to connect to the appropriate database.

Next, you need to configure some environment variables in the ".env" file

Moving on, you need to run the Tailwind files and styles, so to run on our server, use this command:

    npm run build:styles

Performing all the above steps, you just need to run

    npm run dev
